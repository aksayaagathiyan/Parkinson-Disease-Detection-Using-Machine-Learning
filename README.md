# Parkinson-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect Parkinson's disease (PD) early and accurately based on patient data, such as voice recordings, motor signals, or other clinical features. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is crucial for better management and treatment of the disease.
